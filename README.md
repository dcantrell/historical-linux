# Running Historical Linux Distributions #

Looking at past Linux distributions can be educational.  It can be interesting
to see how some things have not really changed all that much or how very
different they used to be.

This project aims to make running these older Linux distributions somewhat
easier.  It's not trivial anymore, but it's not impossible.  This project
consists of scripts and notes that I've written to set up the virtual machine
image and then the recommended command to run them.  Patches are welcome,
especially if you run in to problems launching one of the guests on a
particular system.

The list below contains the current in-progress or available distributions in
this project:

    RHL-5.1/
        Red Hat Linux 5.1 for i386
        Released on May 22, 1998, this release was codenamed "Manhattan" and
        came with the 2.0.34 kernel.  The system used glibc, as that was new for the 5.x series.
        New in this release were linuxconf, Netscape, and a preview of the
        GNOME desktop environment (available for separate installation, not
        part of the actual distribution).

The subdirectories above contain my notes and scripts that helped me prepare the virtual guest disk image.  If you are just interested in running the guest, you can download the image and suggested command here:

I welcome requests and suggestions for other old distributions to set up.  The one catch is that it must be publicly available.  Everything I am setting up is still publicly available.  Sites carrying historical Linux distributions:

Thanks and enjoy seeing Linux from many many years ago.
