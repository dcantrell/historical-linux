# Running Historical Linux Distributions #

Looking at past Linux distributions can be educational.  It can be interesting
to see how some things have not really changed all that much or how very
different they used to be.

This project aims to make running these older Linux distributions somewhat
easier.  It's not trivial anymore, but it's not impossible.  This project
consists of scripts and notes that I've written to set up the virtual machine
image and then the recommended command to run them.  Patches are welcome,
especially if you run in to problems launching one of the guests on a
particular system.

The list below contains the current in-progress or available distributions in
this project:

| Subdirectory | Name | Architecture | Release Date |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| RHL-5.1/ | Red Hat Linux 5.1 | i386 | May 22, 1998 |

The subdirectories above contain my notes and scripts that helped me prepare
the virtual guest disk image.  If you are just interested in running the guest,
you can download the image and suggested command here:

I welcome requests and suggestions for other old distributions to set up.  The
one catch is that it must be publicly available.  Everything I am setting up is
still publicly available.  Sites carrying historical Linux distributions:

Thanks and enjoy seeing Linux from many many years ago.
